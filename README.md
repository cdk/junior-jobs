# CDK Junior Jobs

Following from the concept used by open source project like [KDE](https://kde.org/),
the CDK has long had a set of junior jobs. Junior jobs are "bug fixes and small features
that have been identified as a good way to get involved with an existing project"
<sup>[1](https://community.kde.org/KDE/Junior_Jobs)</sup>. The
[first CDK junior job](https://sourceforge.net/p/cdk/junior-jobs/1/) was
defined in 2007, when the CDK was hosted by SourceForge.
